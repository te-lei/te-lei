-  Hi, I’m @te-lei
-  I’m interested in music (virtually everything but a lot of technno/tech house), video games, extended 
   reality (XR), motion graphics, and a bunch of other things
-  I’m currently learning Business but I'm beginning to learn python and java for Data Analytics on the side.
-  I’m looking to collaborate on tasks I'll begin and ones I'll be assigned.
-  Reach me on this github.
